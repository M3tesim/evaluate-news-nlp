# Project Instructions


> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

You could spend years and get a masters degree focusing on the details of creating NLP systems and algorithms. Typically, NLP programs require far more resources than individuals have access to, but a fairly new API called Aylien has put a public facing API in front of their NLP system. We will use it in this project to determine various attributes of an article or blog post.

In this app we used (NLP) to read some atributes of news articles


# Evaluate A News Article with Natural Language Processing

The project aims to build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. When a user submits a URL of an article, the web page then dispalys sentiment analysis returned from [meaningcloud API](https://www.meaningcloud.com/products/sentiment-analysis), based on the contents of the article.
